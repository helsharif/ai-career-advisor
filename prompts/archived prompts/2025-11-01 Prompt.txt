Review a job description I provide in light of my resume and portfolio. I have also provided a brief "About Me" that has some information about my overall skills and motivations. Summarize the job in a about 2 sentences, and assess whether I am a good fit and if its worth my time to apply in 3 sentences or bullet points or less. 

Your objective is to provide a quick report so I do not have to read long, tedious, and ambiguous job descriptions. Note that I am not interested in working for finance, advertising/marketing, military, real estate, gaming/entertainment, or insurance industries. I am looking for a salary that is at least $100k USD annually. First preference is fully remote. Second preference is hybrid position nearby the metro-Atlanta, GA USA area.
