Hi, I’m Husayn. I’m a Senior Data Scientist and Georgia Tech Ph.D. with over eight years of experience working with machine learning, geospatial analytics, and complex real world data. I enjoy taking messy information and turning it into insights that help people make better decisions.

My work spans remote sensing, environmental analytics, and applied AI, backed by models, pipelines, and dashboards I’ve built for researchers, engineers, and operational teams. I also mentor students and early career professionals who are developing their skills in data science and programming.

Grounded in civil engineering and hydrology, I bring a practical way of understanding complex systems, and that foundation still shapes how I approach data and problem solving. I now apply these skills across a wider range of fields where careful analysis can support meaningful, evidence based improvements in science, technology, and public health.
